# Car-Simulator
While looking at javascript projects, i came across a prospect for a car parking simulation game, this felt kinda personal to me, as i have grown up playing such games. Well, So i gave it a shot, and developed a Basic Javascript based car game, right now it only includes 1 track, 1 car and a parking space, i do intend to add more features shortly.
